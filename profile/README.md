PGV offers patch-type EEG sensor, originally developed by Dr. Tsuyoshi Sekitani, Osaka-University’s distinguished professor. Combining high precision analog circuit with flexible, stretchable, and user-safe electrode sheet, the patch-type EEG sensor can pick up μV brain wave signal comparable to traditional EEG equipment.

The company also provides AI analysis services to research institutions conducting clinical research activities using brainwave, and companies having interests in neuro research (or neuro marketing).
